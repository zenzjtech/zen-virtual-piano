# Korean Localization Support

- Added Korean (`ko`) locale support to `public/_locales` for extension store listing.
- Added Korean (`ko`) locale files to `src/lib/i18n/locales/` including `common.json`, `notifications.json`, `piano.json`, `settings.json`, and `sheet.json`.
- Updated `src/lib/i18n/index.ts` to include Korean resources in the i18n configuration.
- Updated `src/lib/i18n/locales/en/settings.json` to include "Korean" in the language selection list.
- Ensured translations are SEO-aware (using terms like "가상 피아노", "Zen 피아노") and culturally appropriate.
