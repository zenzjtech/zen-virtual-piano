# 2025-11-16: Fix Sound Settings Popup Closing on MIDI Select Click

## Summary
Fixed an issue where the sound settings popup would unexpectedly close when clicking on the MIDI device select dropdown. Applied the same technique used in the sheet search dialog to prevent popup closure when select menus are open.

## Changes Made

### sound-settings-popup.tsx
- Added `isMidiSelectOpen` state to track when the MIDI select dropdown is open
- Created `handleClickAway` function that prevents popup closure when MIDI select is open
- Added `onOpen` and `onClose` props to the MIDI Select component to update the state
- Updated ClickAwayListener to use the custom `handleClickAway` function

## Technical Details
The fix follows the same pattern as the sheet search dialog:
1. Track select dropdown state with boolean flag
2. Check this flag in click away handler before closing
3. Update state when select opens/closes via onOpen/onClose props

This prevents accidental popup closure while users are interacting with the MIDI device selection dropdown.

## Impact
- Small: Only affects sound settings popup behavior
- Low risk: No breaking changes, only improves UX
- High benefit: Fixes frustrating user experience issue

## Next Steps
1. Test MIDI device selection functionality
2. Verify popup behavior with other select components
3. Consider applying similar fix to other popups with select components
